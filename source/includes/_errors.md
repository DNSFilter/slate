Screenshot image requests will always return an image as a response even if there was an error with the request. A special image is returned for these conditions so that if it is being displayed to an end user it will still display something and wonâ€™t break.

These error images are customizable for each account through the Account Dashboard page.

Error conditions include: processing (visiting and generating the image now), unavailable (target website did not respond, was down, or returned invalid content), account request limits reached, and credential errors.

Status Code | Meaning
