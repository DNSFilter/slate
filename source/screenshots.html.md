# Screenshot API Introduction

> An example of what a website screenshot can look like:

The Web Shrinker screenshots API gives developers the ability to capture an image of what a particular website looks like in a browser window. You can then include these images in your own web pages or do some other processing on them in your preferred programming language.

This technique has been used on many popular sites including the major search engines. An example of what a thumbnail can look like can be seen on the right side of this paragraph. The thumbnail being displayed is of the main Web Shrinker web site generated by our servers using our own thumbnail API.

While thumbnails are commonly used on web pages they can also easily be integrated into other applications and frameworks. For instance, say you have a PHP application that needs images of web sites so they can be included in a PDF report, or an application which tracks visual changes on web sites. The possibilities are endless. That’s why we try to make integration with Web Shrinker as easy as possible by offering SDKs and allowing developers access to the underlying API via simple HTTPS requests.

# Authentication

To make API requests you need to have an access key and secret key. If you don't have an access key yet, you can register for a free account on our [account dashboard](https://dashboard.webshrinker.com/register).

There are two methods of authentication that can be used to make API requests: Basic HTTP Authentication and Pre-signed URLs.

## Basic HTTP Authentication

> Example HTTP request:

```http
GET /thumbnails/v2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29t?size=xlarge HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic Yzk1NDJkMDFkNjlmOjE3OTAyYzJjOWIzYQ==
Host: api.webshrinker.com
```

Basic authentication requires that you send your API access and secret key with each request to the service over HTTPS. Most programming frameworks and SDKs support sending Basic HTTP Authentication “out of the box” with a simple function call.

The access key and secret key are used as the “username” and “password” for Basic Authentication.

If you are crafting the "Authorization" header yourself it is the word "Basic" followed by the base64-encoded string "your-access-key:your-secret-key". Additional information about this HTTP header can be found on [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) on Wikipedia.

## Pre-signed URLs

> Example pre-signed screenshot:

> <a target="_blank" href="https://api.webshrinker.com/thumbnails/v2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vic2hyaW5rZXIuY29t?size=large&key=NB6E8ZYEYTo8brr73dmT&hash=3a1c610060246f4d6470311f8a4e9963">https://api.webshrinker.com/thumbnails/v2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vic2hyaW5rZXIuY29t?size=large&key=NB6E8ZYEYTo8brr73dmT&hash=3a1c610060246f4d6470311f8a4e9963</a>

Generating a pre-signed URL allows you to make requests without revealing your secret key. It’s perfect for situations where you need to embed a request in an application or in a webpage but don’t want users to know your secret key, preventing a third party from making unauthorized requests against your account.

The URL used to make the API request is signed using your access and secret key but the URL itself doesn’t contain the secret key. Instead it contains an extra parameter called "hash".

The "hash" is the MD5 hash of your secret key, a colon (":"), and the request URL and options. 

```shell
WS_ACCESS_KEY="your access key"
WS_SECRET_KEY="your secret key"

URL=($(echo -n "http://www.example.com" | base64))

REQUEST="thumbnails/v2/$URL?key=$WS_ACCESS_KEY&size=xlarge"
HASH=($(echo -n "$WS_SECRET_KEY:$REQUEST" | md5sum))

echo "https://api.webshrinker.com/$REQUEST&hash=$HASH"
```

```php
<?php
$access_key = "your access key";
$secret_key = "your secret key";

$url = base64_encode("http://www.example.com");

$signedUrl  = "thumbnails/v2/{$url}?key={$access_key}&size=xlarge";
$signedUrl .= "&hash=" . md5(sprintf("%s:%s", $secret_key, $signedUrl));
$signedUrl  = "https://api.webshrinker.com/{$signedUrl}";

echo "$signedUrl\n";
?>
```

# Making Requests

## Image Requests

```shell
curl -v -u "access-key:secret-key" "https://api.webshrinker.com/thumbnails/v2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vic2hyaW5rZXIuY29tLw==?size=xlarge" -o screenshot.png
```

```php
<?php

function webshrinker_v2($access_key, $secret_key, $url, $options=array()) {
	$options['key'] = $access_key;

	$parameters = http_build_query($options);

	$request = sprintf("thumbnails/v2/%s?%s", base64_encode($url), $parameters);
	$hash = md5(sprintf("%s:%s", $secret_key, $request));

	return "https://api.webshrinker.com/{$request}&hash={$hash}";
}

$access_key = "your access key";
$secret_key = "your secret key";

$url = "http://www.example.com";
$request = webshrinker_v2($access_key, $secret_key, $url, [
	'size' => 'xlarge'
]);

// Initialize cURL and use pre-signed URL authentication
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $request);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$image_data = curl_exec($ch);
$status_code = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

switch($status_code) {
	case 200:
		// $image_data contains the screenshot of the site
		// Do something with the image
		echo "The screenshot was saved to: screenshot.png\n";
		file_put_contents('screenshot.png', $image_data);
		break;
	case 202:
		// The website is being visited and the screenshot created
		// $image_data contains the placeholder loading image
		echo "The screenshot is being created, the placeholder image was saved to: screenshot.png\n";
		file_put_contents('screenshot.png', $image_data);
		break;
	case 400:
		// Bad or malformed HTTP request
		echo "Bad or malformed HTTP request\n";
		break;
	case 401:
		// Unauthorized
		echo "Unauthorized - check your access and secret key permissions\n";
		break;
	case 402:
		// Request limit reached
		echo "Account request limit reached\n";
		break;
}

?>
```

This endpoint returns a PNG image in the size requested for the specified URL.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.webshrinker.com/thumbnails/v2/<url>`

### URL

Parameter | Required | Default | Description
--------- | -------- | ------- | -----------
url | true | | The URL is part of the request and not an additional parameter. It should be Base64-encoded for maximum compatibility.

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Required | Default | Description
--------- | -------- | ------- | -----------
key | true (if using Pre-signed URLs) | | Your account access key to use for the request.
size | true | | The size of the image to be returned. Valid values: micro, tiny, verysmall, small, large, xlarge, 2xlarge, 3xlarge, or a custom size like 320x240.
viewport | false | 1280x1024 | The width and height that the browser window will use for the screenshot capture. Think of this as the users screen size.
fullsize | false | false | Returns a screenshot of the entire webpage and not just what is visible in the viewport.
refresh | false | false | Returns the most recent screenshot if it's available. It will also request that the URL be visited again and a fresh screenshot be captured.
expires | false | | A unix timestamp of a future date when the pre-signed URL request will expire and cannot be used any more.
_ | false | | Can be used as a cache buster to force a users browser to load the latest screenshot image. A good value for this would be the current unix timestamp. If using pre-signed URLs, do *not* include this parameter when generating the hash.
<aside class="success">
You can use either Basic HTTP Authentication or Pre-signed URLs to make image requests.
